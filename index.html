<h1>Intelligent perception, control, and analysis lab (Ipca-lab)</h1>
</div>
<p>Intelligent perception, control, and analysis lab is directed by Prof. Wen-An Zhang and Prof. Xiang Qiu at the Department of Control science and Engineering, College of Information Engineering, 
Zhejiang University of Technology. We focus on intelligent sensing, control and learning for networked control systems. Current research interests contain networked motion control, 
active disturbance rejection control, fault-tolerant control, prognostics and health managementinformation.</p>
